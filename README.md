## Operating Systems

:open_book: _Modern Operating Systems_ by A. S. Tannenbaum & H. Bos (2024)

_Operating System Concepts_ A. Silbersschatz et al. (2021)

## Networking

:green_book: _Computer Networks_ by A. S. Tannenbaum & D. J. Wetherall (5th Ed.) (2011)

A very comprehensive book, traversing through all layers of the OSI model. While sometimes a little lengthy in examples and historical references, this sheds light on why things are the way they are and nicely complements the purely technical discussions. However, the world has changed a lot since the release of the fifth edition. Thus the book contains some quite dated parts.

_The Art of Mac Malware, Vol 2_ by P. Wardle (2025)




## Cryptography

:green_book: _Understanding Cryptography_ by C. Paar and J. Pelzl (2014)

Nice introductory read on cryptography. Especially useful as reference for standard encryption and hashing algorithms.

---

:green_book: _New Directions in Cryptography_ by W. Diffie and M. E. Hellman (1976)

I don't think I have to say why this is a must-read. Really revolutionary, especially when considering the time this was published.


## Information and Coding Theory

_Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems_ by C. E. Shannon (1946)

_Quantum Information Theory_ by M. M. Wilde (2017)

_Error Control Coding_ by S. Lin & D. J. Costello (2004)


## Probability, Statistics and Machine Learning

_The Art of Statistics_ by D. Spiegelhalter (2020)

_Statistics Done Wrong_ by A. Reinhart (2015)

_All of Statistics_ by L. Wasserman (2004)

_Probability Theory_ by E. T. Jaynes (2003)

_Computer Age Statistical Inference_ by B. Efron & T. Hastie (2016)

_Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms_ by D. J. C. MacKay (2003)

_The Book of Why_ by J. Pearl (2019)

_The Signal and the Noise_ by N. Silver (2015)


## System Performance

:blue_book: _The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis_ by R. Jain (1991)

:blue_book: _Systems Performance_ by B. Gregg (2021)

I only partially read both of these books for a class I took on system performance evaluation. They nicely complement each other. Jain's book is not very up to date from a technological standpoint but it brings a very nice technical overview on how one should execute performance testing. It is a quite academic read and establishes a good theoretical foundation on the topic. Gregg's book on the other hand is very practical and explains various schemes and tools one can use to evaluate system performance. It however brushes over the relevant points from a theoretical viewpoint - which is fine as this is clearly not the goal of this book. Thus, I would recommend reading both of them: first Jain, then Gregg.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

:blue_book: _Grokking Algorithms_ by A. Y. Bhargava (2016)

Fun but basic introductory read on algorithms. Nice to get a taste and to learn the "classics" like binary search, BFS/DFS or Djikstra but not more than that. What certainly makes this book special are the many lovely illustrations.

_Introduction to Algorithms_ by T. H. Cormen et al. (2022)

_The Algorithm Design Manual_ by S. S. Skiena (2020)

## Programming Languages

_Programming with 64-bit ARM Assembly Language_ by S. Smith (2020)

_Assembly Language for x86 Processors_ by K. Irvine (2019)


## Compilers

_Compilers_ by A. V. Aho et al. (2007)


## Hardware and System Architecture

_Digital Design and Computer Architecture_ by D. M. Harris & S. L. Harris (2007)

_Structured Computer Architecture_ by A. S. Tannenbaum & T. Austin (2012)

_Computer Systems_ by R. E. Bryant & D. R. O'Hallaron (2016)


## Physics

:green_book: _Theoretische Physik_ by M. Bartelmann et al. (2014)

German only, but a really nice read on the basic concepts of classical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics as well as thermodynamics and statistical physics. Used it as complementary read while studying for my exams in these topics. Covers everything in a nice and understandable way with lots of illustrations, contextual information and the key mathematical concepts required to understand the physics.

_General Relativity_ by M. P. Hobson et al. (2014)


## Mathematics

:green_book: _Div, grad, curl and all that_ by H. M. Schey (2005)

Nice slim introductory read on vector calculus and its application in electrodynamics.

_From Calculus to Cohomology_ by I. Madsen & J. Tornehave (1997)
